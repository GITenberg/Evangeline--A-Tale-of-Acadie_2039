description: Longfellow's Evangeline comes from a true story. The tale of young Emmeline
  Labiche and the true love of her life, Louis Arceneaux. The pair were separated
  when the British invaded Nova Scotia in 1755, and Louis (Gabriel in the poem) was
  forced on a ship and set out to sea. Orphaned, Emmeline was adopted by the family
  of the Widow Borda, who regarded her as not of this earth, but rather as their guardian
  angel, and this is why they called her no longer Emmeline, but Evangeline, or God's
  little angel. The family was exiled to Maryland, but Maryland was no home for them;
  and eventually the family joined other Acadians in Louisiana. In Louisiana, Evangeline
  began to search for Louis.
